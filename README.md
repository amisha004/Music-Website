# Music-Website

* A music website is just a webpage where you may listen to music and pause it.
* Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a website that can play/pause music. 
* I used HTML to create a basic layout, then utilised CSS to enhance the design by adding a background and a play/pause button icon. 
* Basic JavaScript features like if-else and document were utilised. 
* To play and pause our music, we used getElementById.
